/* 

This file should only contain packages flagged as Essential and any
extra dependencies they require.

We resolve the dependencies of the included packages recursively to
produce a list of packages which are passed to debootstrap to produce a
bootstrap filesystem capable of installing additional packages via
fab-install. 

No more (e.g., a fully bootable system), and no less.

Notes:

* Do not rely on bringing in essential packages through dependencies.

* Avoid including "essential" packages which are not really essential
  for satisfying our goal.

  (e.g., they have swappable alternatives, or are not standard
  across Debian-based distributions)
