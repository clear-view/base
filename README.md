# tklx/base

A super slim root filesystem specifically designed to be used as a base
image for application [container][container] images.

Based on [Debian GNU/Linux][debian], the ``rootfs.tar.xz`` weighs in at
only 12MB, and has access to largest GNU/Linux software repository with
over [56,800 packages][debian_packages].

## Features

- Based on Debian GNU/Linux ([why debian?][why-debian]).
- Runtime agnostic (use with [Docker][docker], [CoreOS rkt][rkt], etc.).
- Built from scratch specifically for container usage.
- Smallest Debian based image as far as we know.
- Comfortable [interactive][bashrc] terminal (colorized, promptpath).
- Convenience [apt-clean][apt-clean] script to clean cache and optionally docs/locales.

## Usage (Docker)

```console
docker pull tklx/base:0.1.0
docker run -it tklx/base:0.1.0 /bin/bash
```

```dockerfile
FROM tklx/base:0.1.0
RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install PACKAGES && apt-clean --aggressive
ENTRYPOINT ["something"]
```

## Usage (CoreOS rkt)

```console
rkt trust --prefix=tklx.org/base
rkt fetch tklx.org/base:0.1.0
rkt run tklx.org/base:0.1.0 --interactive --exec /bin/bash
```

```console
acbuild begin
acbuild set-name example.com/test
acbuild dep add tklx.org/base:0.1.0
acbuild run apt-get update && apt-get -y install PACKAGES && apt-clean --aggressive
acbuild set-exec something
acbuild write test-latest-linux-amd64.aci
acbuild end
```

## Status

Currently on major version zero (0.y.z). Per [Semantic Versioning][semver],
major version zero is for initial development, and should not be considered
stable. Anything may change at any time.

Release files are available [here][releases].

## Versioning

Releases are based on [Semantic Versioning][semver], and use the format
of ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``. In a nutshell, the version will be incremented
based on the following:

- ``MAJOR``: incompatible and/or major changes, upgraded OS release
- ``MINOR``: backwards-compatible new features and functionality
- ``PATCH``: backwards-compatible bugfixes and package updates

## Issue Tracker

TKLX uses a central [issue tracker][tracker] on GitHub for reporting and
tracking of bugs, issues and feature requests.

## About

In case you're interested, TKLX is pronounced _/tickle-ex/_.

TKLX is a project by [TurnKey GNU/Linux][turnkeylinux]. TurnKey
GNU/Linux is a Debian based library of system images that pre-integrates
